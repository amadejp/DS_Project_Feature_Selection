## About this repository ##

This is the repository used for FRI Data Science Project Competition. The authors, Leon Hvastja and Amadej Pavšič, are working on feature selection in sparse datasets with Outbrain. 

More specifically, our goal is to test different feature ranking algorithms, in order to speed up subsequential processes. Ground truth for our testing is Outbrain's in-house developed autoML, which is accurate, but relatively slow.
